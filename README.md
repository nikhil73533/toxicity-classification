# toxicity-classification
## Problem Statement:
The prevalence of online toxicity has become a growing concern in social media platforms, and it can negatively impact individuals and communities. In this assignment, you will work with a toxic comment classification dataset that includes comments labeled with multiple toxic classes, and use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to build a multilabel predictive model.
The dataset used in this assignment contains a large number of comments from various online platforms, such as Wikipedia, Reddit, and Twitter. Each comment is labeled with multiple classes of toxicity, including severe toxicity, obscene, threat, insult, identity hate, and others. A comment may belong to one or more toxicity classes, making this a multilabel classification task.
